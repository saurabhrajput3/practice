# Coffee Machine Simulator
## This is a Java console application that simulates a coffee machine. The machine contains the ingredients required to make different types of coffee, including water, milk, and coffee beans, and has a money box that stores the money collected from selling coffee.

## The application provides a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) console interface with the following options:

- buy: Enables the user to buy a coffee of their choice. The coffee will be dispensed only if the machine contains enough ingredients to make that coffee, otherwise it will show an error message. After the coffee is dispensed, the money in the money box will be updated as well as the remaining ingredients.  

- fill: Lets the user add ingredients to the machine as required.  

- take: Enables the maintainer to take the money from the money box.  

- show: Enables the user to check the ingredients left in the machine.  

- exit: Stops the simulation and exits the application.   

- analytics: Displays the count of all the coffees sold, the amount earned, and the ingredients consumed.
